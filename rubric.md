Note: Software can't talk to hardware directly- software can make hardware generate signal voltage on signal processors, but there needs to be something physical (eg. a relay) that responds to that signal.

* [ ] Solution 1
    * [ ] Programming languages and frameworks are identified
    * [ ] Any needed libraries are identified
    * [ ] Hardware is identified
    * [ ] A clear explanation of how these pieces will work together is present
    * [ ] The solution is feasible
* [ ] Solution 2
    * [ ] Solution 2 is substantially different than solution 1
